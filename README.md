# HarpJS boilerplate for the HTML5UP theme Alpha

This version of the Alpha [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) template has been modified to work with [Harp JS](http://harpjs.com/) as a [boilerplate](http://harpjs.com/blog/v0-12-1-boilerplates).

Additionally, this version of the Alpha template includes a sample blog directory with two posts.

This Harp boilerplate was built with: 
- Jade for HTML templating 
- Sass for the CSS using the original HTML5 UP SCSS files.

    A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
    dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
    generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
    new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.
